## The Cookie Jar method explained

Each of us has dealt with our own share of challenges and hardships over the course of our lives. David Goggins, an ultramarathon runner and former Navy SEAL, has as well. Having run the toughest marathons, and been through all kinds of military training, Goggins came up a with a simple technique to overcome any obstacles going forward.

The Cookie Jar Method works like this :

- Imagine you have Empty Cookie Jar into which you place all of the challenges that you have overcome or the accomplishments that you have achieved (Cookies).

- Whenever you are facing an obstacle or hardship, refer back to your cookie jar to remind yourself of everything that you have been through and how resilient you are.

- This cookie jar serves as a mental reserve to dig into and serve as a reference point for your ability to make it through whatever youâ€™re encountering.
